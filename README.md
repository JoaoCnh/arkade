# Arkade
Hi, my name is **Jo√£o Cunha** and this is **Arkade**
**Arkade** is my Javascript playground where I brush up my skills. Currently it is developed using **React**, **Webpack 2**, **Redux**, **React Router** and some more...
I have more plans for the platform and if it grows I will be moving it towards external hosting for proper management.
